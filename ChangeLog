        * I can't believe how little time I've been able to put into this
        over the holidays. I was hoping to have so much more new stuff in
        0.04 than I do.
        
        * Some configuration options are loaded as they should be:
        palette, font, directories, time display, and the classic mode
        switch. Audio settings are next on the list.

Tue Dec 23 22:50:42 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Devices don't show up as directories anymore. Dunno how that
        happened...

Mon Dec  1 01:00:26 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Tried to figure out how to do single-step playback in the
        pattern editor (the '4' and '8' keys), but couldn't get it to
        work. Oh well.
        
Mon Nov 24 14:56:33 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Added alt-s key to pattern editor.

Sat Nov  8 12:05:45 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Lots of stuff, I can't remember what.

Mon Sep 22 14:14:59 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Fixed a dumb bug with the Axx effect that crept up earlier.

        * Fonts are now stored in ~/.schism/fonts/ instead of the current
        directory.
        
        * Started work on loading/saving settings (~/.schism/config).

Sat Sep 13 22:11:44 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Whoa... been forgetting about this. :P

        * The load-sample page exists, but it's nonfunctional.

        * Title text (the copyright thing) is much more flexible -- I
        took advantage of some GCC-ness so I don't have to figure out
        where the text is supposed to be placed. Wee.

        * The settings page still doesn't work, but it at least sets the
        thumbbars to sane values.

        * Fixed a bug with loading songs having a "+++" in the first
        order. This crept up as a result of my trying to fix another bug
        if the song has no orders... bleah.

Tue Jul  8 16:57:56 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Fixed vibrato volume command in IT files: it's not speed, it's
        DEPTH... this made my 10k entry sound really crappy.

Tue Jun 17 15:27:11 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * New 'CLASSIC_MODE' status flag. With this enabled, some stuff
        behaves more like good old Impulse Tracker :)

        * Implemented a few of the fields on the config screen.

        * Killed a couple stupid bugs on the instrument list.

        * Fixed the note mask handling on the pattern editor. (I think.)

Mon Jun 16 11:46:49 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Version 0.031a.

        * Note translation table works. (partially... it's at least
        usable, but only a couple of the keys work)

Thu Jun 12 17:07:18 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * BIG BIG CHANGE. No longer am I building against an
        already-installed version of libmodplug; I'm moving it in with
        the source, compiling it, and linking it statically. This will
        make it much much easier for me to fix bugs I find without having
        to reinstall libmodplug every time, too. (for example, the broken
        DigiTrakker volume slides)

        * Another big change: now video modes with > 8 bit pixel formats
        are handled properly. (This still needs a lot of optimizing.)

Wed Jun 11 17:42:40 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Added track views for the info page. I tried to make the
        drawing function as general as possible, so it shouldn't be
        difficult to add new ones.

        * Fixed .liq module title reading (even though Modplug doesn't
        load them :).

        * Playing samples have little lines drawn on them to show where
        they are. (Seems like IT doesn't do this...?)

        * The very first hints of a configuration screen are in place.

Sun Jun  8 14:51:30 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Tons of changes! Bumping the version up to 0.03a.

        * Info page works. Only two views at the moment, but it works.

        * Now using double buffering (like for the ITF editor) - much
        cleaner code, easier to write, and a smaller binary as a result.
        (And there was happiness throughout the land.)

        * SDL parachute isn't disabled for non-debug builds.

        * Moved a large portion of the key handling code to a new file,
        thus making page.c much easier to deal with.

        * Changed some file type descriptions to be more consistent with
        Impulse Tracker's. This was actually harder than it sounds. :)

        * Added a new bit in the pattern editor help about imported FT2
        effects.

        * A bunch of messages about the audio/video are now dumped to the
        program log (Ctrl-F1) on startup.

        * Much, much more -- too much to list.

Sun Jun  1 21:53:58 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Sample list: trimming, signed/unsigned convert, quality
        convert, reverse, centralise data, and delete implemented. Wee.

        * Added a focus handler that causes a 500ms delay per cycle if
        the window isn't focused -- no sense in updating the screen all
        the time when it's in the background. There's a 100ms delay if a
        dialog/menu is active, but I might change that later on if it
        annoys me ;)

        * Shaved 13kb from the binary size. Can't quite figure out how
        that happened, but ok :)

Fri May 30 10:57:46 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Finally got around to writing the dialog code. This involved
        rewriting large portions of other code where I wasn't really
        thinking about the fact that dialogs have items ;) This means
        that the number input on thumbbars is working now (though I
        could've probably done it in far less code), as is the play time
        (Ctrl-P) and a bunch of other things that were previously
        noticeably unimplemented.

Wed May 28 23:16:39 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * More playback keys implemented (and properly)... thanks to +-
        for the amazingly detailed e-mail! :)

        * Channel solo/mute now actually solo/mute the channel, not just
        pretend to.

        * Currently playing row/order are now drawn in a different color
        like they're supposed to be.

        * Pattern editor: centralise cursor, current row highlighting,
        and playback tracing implemented. Redrawing code improved muchly
        as well, so the playback tracing is nice and smooth.

        * Alt-F1 -> Alt-F8 (toggle channel 1-8 muted) work.

        * Implemented a couple more global keys, and a few toggles on the
        info page just for kicks. None of this means anything yet, of
        course, because the info page is completely blank :)

Sun May 25 22:54:10 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Weee! Many big changes, notably block selection is working
        properly (even with shift-tab), and! IT PLAYS THE SONG :) The
        status text is now working as well, including the ability to
        flash messages on it (like "cursor step set to 2").

        * Note mask replication is working.

        * Added a couple new experimental palettes.

        * A few big changes in the ITF editor, mostly trying out SDL's
        double buffering support and doing a single SDL_Flip(screen) when
        the screen needs redrawn, rather than tons of calls to
        SDL_UpdateRects(). I might keep this; then again, I might not.

        * Too much to mention... I should be logging stuff more often,
        but then again, who cares besides me at the moment? :P

Mon May 19 17:48:37 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Starting ChangeLog.

        * Now using automake/autoconf, after exactly three hours of
        coaxing. Seems to work...
