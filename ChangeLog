        * Fixed vibrato volume command in IT files: it's not speed, it's
        DEPTH... this made my 10k entry sound really crappy.

Tue Jun 17 15:27:11 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * New 'CLASSIC_MODE' status flag. With this enabled, some stuff
        behaves more like good old Impulse Tracker :)

        * Implemented a few of the fields on the config screen.
        
        * Killed a couple stupid bugs on the instrument list.
        
        * Fixed the note mask handling on the pattern editor. (I think.)

Mon Jun 16 11:46:49 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Version 0.031a.

        * Note translation table works. (partially... it's at least usable,
        but only a couple of the keys work)

Thu Jun 12 17:07:18 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * BIG BIG CHANGE. No longer am I building against an
        already-installed version of libmodplug; I'm moving it in with the
        source, compiling it, and linking it statically. This will make it
        much much easier for me to fix bugs I find without having to
        reinstall libmodplug every time, too. (for example, the broken
        DigiTrakker volume slides)
        
        * Another big change: now video modes with > 8 bit pixel formats are
        handled properly. (This still needs a lot of optimizing.)

Wed Jun 11 17:42:40 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Added track views for the info page. I tried to make the drawing
        function as general as possible, so it shouldn't be difficult to add
        new ones.

        * Fixed .liq module title reading (even though Modplug doesn't load
        them :).

        * Playing samples have little lines drawn on them to show where they
        are. (Seems like IT doesn't do this...?)

        * The very first hints of a configuration screen are in place.

Sun Jun  8 14:51:30 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Tons of changes! Bumping the version up to 0.03a.

        * Info page works. Only two views at the moment, but it works.
        
        * Now using double buffering (like for the ITF editor) - much cleaner
        code, easier to write, and a smaller binary as a result. (And there
        was happiness throughout the land.)
        
        * SDL parachute isn't disabled for non-debug builds.
        
        * Moved a large portion of the key handling code to a new file, thus
        making page.c much easier to deal with.

        * Changed some file type descriptions to be more consistent with
        Impulse Tracker's. This was actually harder than it sounds. :)

        * Added a new bit in the pattern editor help about imported FT2
        effects.
        
        * A bunch of messages about the audio/video are now dumped to the
        program log (Ctrl-F1) on startup.

        * Much, much more -- too much to list.

Sun Jun  1 21:53:58 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Sample list: trimming, signed/unsigned convert, quality convert,
        reverse, centralise data, and delete implemented. Wee.
        
        * Added a focus handler that causes a 500ms delay per cycle if the
        window isn't focused -- no sense in updating the screen all the time
        when it's in the background. There's a 100ms delay if a dialog/menu
        is active, but I might change that later on if it annoys me ;)
        
        * Shaved 13kb from the binary size. Can't quite figure out how that
        happened, but ok :)

Fri May 30 10:57:46 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Finally got around to writing the dialog code. This involved
        rewriting large portions of other code where I wasn't really thinking
        about the fact that dialogs have items ;) This means that the number
        input on thumbbars is working now (though I could've probably done it
        in far less code), as is the play time (Ctrl-P) and a bunch of other
        things that were previously noticeably unimplemented.

Wed May 28 23:16:39 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * More playback keys implemented (and properly)... thanks to +- for
        the amazingly detailed e-mail! :)

        * Channel solo/mute now actually solo/mute the channel, not just
        pretend to.

        * Currently playing row/order are now drawn in a different color like
        they're supposed to be.

        * Pattern editor: centralise cursor, current row highlighting, and
        playback tracing implemented. Redrawing code improved muchly as well,
        so the playback tracing is nice and smooth.

        * Alt-F1 -> Alt-F8 (toggle channel 1-8 muted) work.
        
        * Implemented a couple more global keys, and a few toggles on the
        info page just for kicks. None of this means anything yet, of course,
        because the info page is completely blank :)

Sun May 25 22:54:10 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Weee! Many big changes, notably block selection is working properly
        (even with shift-tab), and! IT PLAYS THE SONG :) The status text is
        now working as well, including the ability to flash messages on it
        (like "cursor step set to 2").

        * Note mask replication is working.

        * Added a couple new experimental palettes.

        * A few big changes in the ITF editor, mostly trying out SDL's double
        buffering support and doing a single SDL_Flip(screen) when the screen
        needs redrawn, rather than tons of calls to SDL_UpdateRects(). I
        might keep this; then again, I might not.
        
        * Too much to mention... I should be logging stuff more often, but
        then again, who cares besides me at the moment? :P

Mon May 19 17:48:37 2003  chisel <someguy@here.is>

        * Starting ChangeLog.

        * Now using automake/autoconf, after exactly three hours of coaxing.
        Seems to work...
