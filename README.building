As I've said dozens of times, simply renaming the built program will fix
these issues painlessly. This is what I've done, but I'm having trouble
building it because auto* is crap. :P

This is apparently a frequently asked question.

To build schism, you must build outside of the toplevel source directory.
I recommend making a build directory for your system like this:

$ cd schism2
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make

This way, all the object files and "targets" are all in one place. You
can literally put your build directory anywhere- as long as you run
configure in that directory.


If you don't do this, but instead try something like this:

$ cd schism2
$ ./configure && make

Then configure will make a build directory like above and build there.
Makefiles are placed such that they transfer control to that directory.
