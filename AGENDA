This document describes a rough set of goals for each release.
It doesn't mean the given feature/fix will appear in that
version, just a rough idea of when developers should give it
attention.

0.5
	fix vibrato bug
		Hxy in which x == rate, y == depth, and speed is how long to wait before the note starts vibrating
		no thats wrong

		 so, "rate" determines how fast vibrato kicks in when you start a note (it kicks in gradually)
 s/when/after/

	shift-f5 is audio driver config
		- remove the oversampling/noise reduction/surround/xbass/reverb
		settings.

	shift-f10 is log viewer

	ctrl-f1 is keyboard debugger

	ctrl-f10 is keymap editor
	ctrl-f11 is font editor
	

0.6
