Default fonts created with ITF by ZaStaR <zastar@uclink4.berkeley.edu>.

Default palette settings are mostly from Impulse Tracker, except Industrial

FT2 palette), and Why Colors? (FT2).

programming by Markus Fick <webmaster@mark-f.de> (spline mixing,

fixes).

Some (small) portions of code have been borrowed from Cheesetracker,
