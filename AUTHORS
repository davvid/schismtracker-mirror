Based (obviously) on Impulse Tracker by Jeffrey Lim <jeff@lim.com.au>.

Default fonts created with ITF by ZaStaR <zastar@uclink4.berkeley.edu>.

Default palette settings are mostly from Impulse Tracker, except
Industrial (mine), Untitled Palette #4 (mine... sorry ;), Violent
(loosely based on the like-named FT2 palette), and Why Colors? (FT2).

Modplug written by Olivier Lapicque <olivierl@jps.net>, with additional
programming by Markus Fick <webmaster@mark-f.de> (spline mixing,
fir-resampler) and Adam Goode <adam@evdebs.org> (endian-ness and char
fixes).

Some (small) portions of code have been borrowed from Cheesetracker,
written by Juan Linietsky <coding@reduz.com.ar>.
