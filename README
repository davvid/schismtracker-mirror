This is actually the very first program I ever did with SDL. (Even the
ITF editor came some amount of time afterward.) It's also the first time
I used threads, the first I ever got autoconf to work properly ;), and my
first ever program to have an actual structure.

Considering all that, I'd say this came out pretty well.

- [.features.]

      - Based on Modplug, so there's support for *lots* of file types. If
	you've ever wanted to load, say, a PTM file in Impulse Tracker,
	now's your chance!

      - Since the GUI is written with SDL, it's portable to about any
	system that SDL can run on. (well, as long as Modplug also works
	on it... otherwise there's not much point to the program, now is
	there? :) Most notably, this means that those unfortunate enough
	to have "upgraded" to WinXP can still keep the IT environment.

      - Much improved text entries. They work a bit more like Scream
	Tracker's in that the edit point isn't always fixed to the length
	of the text. Maybe this is what Jeffrey Lim had in mind when he
	wrote that "the routines need to be rewritten" for his text
	entries. :)

      - 12-channel and 64-channel pattern view modes. (IT has a
	64-channel view on the info page, but no corresponding setup in
	the pattern editor.)

      - Thumbbar value editing with the arrow keys is a bit easier: in
	IT, shift-arrows changed the value by a multiple of 4, ctrl-arrow
	changed it by 2, and that was about it. I've added alt-arrow to
	change the value by 8; in addition, holding more than one
	modifier multiplies them -- for example, alt-shift-right will
	increase a value by 32 (8 x 4).

      - Home/end work on the menus, help viewer, and message editor when
	it's in view mode.

      - The greatest sample waveform display on earth. Well, maybe not,
	but the loop points are marked in a different colour from the
	sample data.

      - No free memory stats... I don't see much use for them, what with
	the ability to allocate a 4gb swapfile. :) I've replaced that
	space with visualisation displays: oscilloscope, VU meters, etc.

	(All right, so I have "fake" free memory stats now. Maybe I'll
	think up something useful.)

      - The palette preset selector has been rewritten. Now you can save
	a custom palette to any of 20 different slots. (In theory, at
	least. At the moment, it's still all hard-coded.)

      - Support for Impulse Tracker's font files... an ITF editor is
	included as well, so you can make your own fonts, too! (Very
	loosely based on ZaStaR's ITF.EXE, though not just a clone of it.
	It's missing a few things, but it accomplishes more or less the
	same task.)
