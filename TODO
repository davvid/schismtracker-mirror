===============================================================================

it feels way too slow on ppc mac [storlek]
	- things to try: use SWSURFACE in video.c for macs

	- does mac SDL have lock sync problems (try remove event push from
	audio callback)

	- try increasing audio buffer size

	- can the filters be implemented without an FPU and without clipping?

R% k->state is unnecessary almost all of the time [mrsbrisby]
R% 
R%  	- remove k->state as per dreamsicle
R% 	- use a scancode map of functions k->onkeyup[k->scancode] to return
R% 	- SDL_KEYRELEASE nulls out k->onkeyup when calling (before)
R% 	- this way we can remove shift_release as well
R%
check against impulse tracker: do f5/f6/f7 work with a dialog open? [storlek]

multichannel mode needs implemented [delt]

R% get rid of those environment variables -- make command line options [storlek]
R%
midi output is broken [delt]

resonant filters aren't quite perfect (i'll try to fix this myself) [delt]

windows version crashes constantly (thanks a lot bill) [delt]

single char options for frag-opt are broken... i'm stumped [storlek]
	(this has always been the case; seems like a frag-opt endian bug)

always add or modify the extension of the file being saved (or not?) [storlek]

	>>> i think this is a non-issue now. "Auto" looks at the extension
	>>> now like it always was supposed to. -mrsb

the save function should be a part of fmt, not in audio_loadsave [storlek]

	- agreed. we also need save/load functions for instruments as well.

mouse doesn't work on save module page [storlek]
	*** fix this the Right Way: make a new "list" widget type that mostly
	draws itself (since most lists are so radically different, there's not
	one standard way to draw them all) but has a couple of convenient
	functions to reposition so the cursor is visible, and also handle
	up/down/pgup/pgdn/home/end/click/wheel smartly

make f7 smarter [delt]

clicking those popup-thumbbars (mousebar?) shouldn't immediately change the
value unless it's being dragged. it's too easy to clumsily click the wrong
place and break the song that's playing. [storlek]

click in vis/time area should cycle the vis or time display mode [storlek]

spectrum analyzer visualization (lol wishlist) [storlek]

check timestamps in load/save module page... "19:36pm"? blah [storlek]

entering data in the pattern editor with shift selects the row [storlek]

note preview (caps lock + note) in pattern editor [storlek]

fake numlock needs to be *on* for macs by default [storlek]

	- why? what about ibooks?

never did finish the sample export (alt-t) dialog [storlek]

font editor should be a page like anything else [storlek]

make some keys more logical... [storlek]

	log viewer could go on shift-f10, since the message editor is shift-f9
	and they're kinda-sorta-similar-ish

	font editor should be ctrl-f11, as the palette editor is ctrl-f12...
	that way the "look and feel" settings are next to each other

	ctrl-f1 should show the keyboard status like in impulse tracker (which
	would be fairly useful if we're going to do custom keymappings)

	global settings which are currently on ctrl-f1 should go on shift-f12
	instead - similar stuff as the f12 screen, but less commonly used

	song message: alt-z = clear, alt-p = paste, alt-c = copy, alt-o =
	overwrite message with clipboard data... (hmm. what about alt-c to
	clear the message? will this key be missed? does anyone care if we
	can copy the message to the system clipboard, anyway?)

	get rid of that ctrl-p hack! add middle-click paste if it's that
	important to dump random clipboard data to random widgets.

mtm and mdl loaders are half-broken on big-endian systems (don't load patterns) (will fix these myself) [storlek]

mt2/far/ult/other obscure loaders are fully broken (whatever...) [storlek]

cspeeds aren't being reset to 8363 for empty samples!!1 [storlek]
	... maybe ignore this until we demodplugify?

	>>> isn't this fixed in _convert_to_it?
	>>> or do you mean something else? -mrsb

space on pattern editor should play the notes it inserts [storlek]

tab ordering on some pages [storlek]

system clipboard needs work [storlek]
	doesn't always include all channels
	doesn't always copy (?) - flash feedback when system clipboard set
	when pasting, ask whether to use system or schism clipboard
		(and only ask once for the same clipboard data)

desperately need to document my coding style and stuff so i can stop rewriting
other people's code :P [storlek]

desperately need documentation in general for the program - what's different
from impulse tracker? new keys? what's unimplemented or differently implemented
that might cause problems? how do you do <insert action here>? (something like
the "for windows users" section in the mac os x help would be a good place to
start in writing this) [storlek]


A BIT OF GENIUS: (well maybe :)
make it possible to save patterns, like in FT2... BUT... don't just save the
pattern data, actually allow exporting a pattern AS AN .IT FILE so it'll have
the samples and stuff too. then when loading it just "append" its contents to
the current loaded module. (should probably do something so as not to end up
with 9 copies of all the samples when loading multiple patterns, dunno what.)
this combined with the pattern-to-sample key might be a pretty good substitute
for those who want a bazillion samples for all the drumloops and stuff; they
can write the loop, render to a sample, save the pattern for future tweaks,
then *delete* the pattern and associated samples (btw, should have a "clean up
song" function like modplug that finds unused samples)... and if need be, can
reload that pattern, fix stuff, re-render, and save it again.
another use for this would be immediately apparent for anyone who's tried to
mix two different .it files together for whatever reason. this way, just load
the second file in this append mode, and blammo, two songs stitched together
without any effort at all! [storlek]
