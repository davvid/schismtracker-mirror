ok, i've moved this to the schismdev board
- http://rigelseven.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/storlek/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=schismdev
which should be more flexible than a flat file.

for a release we could just stick the big things that haven't been implemented
in here to fulfill automake's requirement for a TODO file and to let people
know that we're aware that schism tracker is, in fact, still incomplete...
