from here after verifying with the bug reporter that it's been fixed :)

===============================================================================

check against impulse tracker: do f5/f6/f7 work with a dialog open? [storlek]

multichannel mode needs implemented [delt]

"graphics" are all in the wrong colors [storlek]
	- startup logo should be color 11 (currently is 0)
	- instrument envelopes should be color 12 (currently is 3)
	- sample data should be color 13 (currently is 5)

get rid of those environment variables -- make command line options [storlek]

midi output is broken [delt]

resonant filters aren't quite perfect (i'll try to fix this myself) [delt]

windows version crashes constantly (thanks a lot bill) [delt]

single char options for frag-opt are broken... i'm stumped [storlek]
	(this has always been the case; seems like a frag-opt endian bug)

always add or modify the extension of the file being saved (or not?) [storlek]

the save function should be a part of fmt, not in audio_loadsave [storlek]

mouse doesn't work on save module page [storlek]
	*** fix this the Right Way: make a new "list" widget type that mostly
	draws itself (since most lists are so radically different, there's not
	one standard way to draw them all) but has a couple of convenient
	functions to reposition so the cursor is visible, and also handle
	up/down/pgup/pgdn/home/end/click/wheel smartly

make f7 smarter [delt]

clicking those popup-thumbbars (mousebar?) shouldn't immediately change the
value unless it's being dragged. it's too easy to clumsily click the wrong
place and break the song that's playing. [storlek]

click in vis/time area should cycle the vis or time display mode [storlek]

spectrum analyzer visualization (lol wishlist) [storlek]

check timestamps in load/save module page... "19:36pm"? blah [storlek]

entering data in the pattern editor with shift selects the row [storlek]

note preview (caps lock + note) in pattern editor [storlek]

fake numlock needs to be *on* for macs by default [storlek]

never did finish the sample export (alt-t) dialog [storlek]

font editor should be a page like anything else [storlek]

make some keys more logical... [storlek]

	log viewer could go on shift-f10, since the message editor is shift-f9
	and they're kinda-sorta-similar-ish

	font editor should be ctrl-f11, as the palette editor is ctrl-f12...
	that way the "look and feel" settings are next to each other

	ctrl-f1 should show the keyboard status like in impulse tracker (which
	would be fairly useful if we're going to do custom keymappings)

	global settings which are currently on ctrl-f1 should go on shift-f12
	instead - similar stuff as the f12 screen, but less commonly used

	song message: alt-z = clear, alt-p = paste, alt-c = copy, alt-o =
	overwrite message with clipboard data... (hmm. what about alt-c to
	clear the message? will this key be missed? does anyone care if we
	can copy the message to the system clipboard, anyway?)

	get rid of that ctrl-p hack! add middle-click paste if it's that
	important to dump random clipboard data to random widgets.

mtm and mdl loaders are half-broken on big-endian systems (don't load patterns) (will fix these myself) [storlek]

mt2/far/ult/other obscure loaders are fully broken (whatever...) [storlek]

cspeeds aren't being reset to 8363 for empty samples!!1 [storlek]
	... maybe ignore this until we demodplugify?

space on pattern editor should play the notes it inserts [storlek]

tab ordering on some pages [storlek]

system clipboard needs work [storlek]
	doesn't always include all channels
	doesn't always copy (?) - flash feedback when system clipboard set
	when pasting, ask whether to use system or schism clipboard
		(and only ask once for the same clipboard data)

desperately need to document my coding style and stuff so i can stop rewriting
other people's code :P [storlek]

desperately need documentation in general for the program - what's different
from impulse tracker? new keys? what's unimplemented or differently implemented
that might cause problems? how do you do <insert action here>? (something like
the "for windows users" section in the mac os x help would be a good place to
start in writing this) [storlek]
