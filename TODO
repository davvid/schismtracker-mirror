ok, i've moved most of this to the schismdev board
- http://rigelseven.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/storlek/yabb/YaBB.pl?board=schismdev
which should be more flexible than a flat file.

for a release we could just stick the big things that haven't been implemented
in here to fulfill automake's requirement for a TODO file and to let people
know that we're aware that schism tracker is, in fact, still incomplete...


[brackets] after an item indicate who brought it up. please only delete stuff
from here after verifying with the bug reporter that it's been fixed :)

mark something as R% at the beginning of the line if its a refactoring task.

put replies to someone elses task with >>> and sign them

maybe this'd be better if we wikified it? lol :)

===============================================================================

R% k->state is unnecessary almost all of the time [mrsbrisby]
R% 
R%  	- remove k->state as per dreamsicle
R% 	- use a scancode map of functions k->onkeyup[k->scancode] to return
R% 	- SDL_KEYRELEASE nulls out k->onkeyup when calling (before)
R% 	- this way we can remove shift_release as well

check against impulse tracker: do f5/f6/f7 work with a dialog open? [storlek]
	- delt says: no, it didn't...

midi output is broken [delt]

resonant filters aren't quite perfect (i'll try to fix this myself) [delt]

windows version crashes constantly (thanks a lot bill) [delt]

make f7 smarter [delt]

spectrum analyzer visualization (lol wishlist) [storlek]

never did finish the sample export (alt-t) dialog [storlek]

desperately need to document my coding style and stuff so i can stop rewriting
other people's code :P [storlek]

A BIT OF GENIUS: (well maybe :)
make it possible to save patterns, like in FT2... BUT... don't just save the
pattern data, actually allow exporting a pattern AS AN .IT FILE so it'll have
the samples and stuff too. then when loading it just "append" its contents to
the current loaded module. (should probably do something so as not to end up
with 9 copies of all the samples when loading multiple patterns, dunno what.)
this combined with the pattern-to-sample key might be a pretty good substitute
for those who want a bazillion samples for all the drumloops and stuff; they
can write the loop, render to a sample, save the pattern for future tweaks,
then *delete* the pattern and associated samples (btw, should have a "clean up
song" function like modplug that finds unused samples)... and if need be, can
reload that pattern, fix stuff, re-render, and save it again.
another use for this would be immediately apparent for anyone who's tried to
mix two different .it files together for whatever reason. this way, just load
the second file in this append mode, and blammo, two songs stitched together
without any effort at all! [storlek]
