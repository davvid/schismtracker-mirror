This is just general stuff that doesn't exactly fit in the code anywhere.
For a more straightforward list try 'grep TODO *.c' or 'grep FIXME *.c'
(the latter being the more important set of stuff)

A lot of this is just notes to myself, so if something seems cryptic,
ignore it :)

On the subject, it'd be interesting to have an oscilloscope view :)

Key logic is generally a complete nightmare. It should be handled less
haphazardly, and in a manner that would make it easier to remap the
keyboard.

Note playing (i.e. the keyboard) should take an SDL_keysym instead of a
char. Additionally the note trans table should allow more than one key
per note (or other thing).

From the "would be nice to have" department:

        A pattern with > 200 rows should be split into two patterns of
        half the size (or maybe just a 200-row pattern and another one
        for the remaining rows?) to be IT-compliant. MPT can handle
        256-row patterns, which is nice, but they make Impulse Tracker
        die painfully.

        Impulse Tracker actually does this for XM files, but not for IT
        files because they AREN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE THAT MANY ROWS! #*$@&~%

For the pattern bit...
        if (rows > 200) {
                newpat = find_empty_pattern();
                copy rows 128-n to newpat;
                resize the pattern to 128 rows;
                for (order = 0; order < length of orderlist; order++) {
                        if (orderlist[order] == pattern) {
                                insert newpat after this order;
                                order++; // skip the new one
                        }
                }
        }

Instead of going through the whole ugly if (song_is_instrument_mode())
bit every time something needs to get a sample/instrument just for the
name, have a function that generalizes the instrument handling.

[and use 'instrument' for all the function names; it's more general]

I've started this, but it's currently a big mess. :/

If the text in a textbox is changed, the cursor should be moved to the
end of the text. (This is notably annoying in the filename box on the
sample screen.)

- have a function to set the text, not just strcpy

Buttons need to be drawn briefly in a "pressed" state after hitting enter
on them. IT doesn't deal with them being "held" - they are released after
a half second or so - so this could all be done from the key handler.
Note, though, that if the button does something that takes a lot of time,
it's still "pressed" during that time, so the order should go:

      - draw in pressed state
      - run the callback
      - delay for a tiny bit (1/4 second?)
      - draw in released state (if it's still on the same page)


Argh! I was wrong; the button stays pressed until the key is released.
The callback gets run a tiny bit after enter is pressed, but if it's on
the same page the button stays pressed for as long as enter is. Maybe on
the key release event, if the current item is a button (and if it's the
enter key), redraw it in the released state?

Initializing even ONE instrument when the song was initially in sample
mode totally screws up Modplug. (This means just hitting F4 with a song
that's in sample mode will fubar it, as instruments are set up when
they're selected.)

Modplug seems to use 'if (m_nInstruments)' in code to check whether the
file's in instrument mode.

(How are these two things related?)


This just in: try loading a sample-mode .it with a lot of samples (over
35) and switching to the ins. list: seems that if an instrument exists,
it gets used. Probably there should be a more solid way of testing this.
Sounds like time to start some deep hacking with modplug...

a few ideas for some new keys...

Pattern Editor:
        Ctrl-L - one-shot cursor centralise (unlike Ctrl-C)

Sample List:
        Alt-I - invert sample
        Alt-T - smart sample trim (instead of save ST3 sample, which is
                getting rather dated by now) - ask for a "variance" and
                trim all samples from the beginning and end of the sample
                that are within that percent of zero.
        ??? - interpolate sample start / end to zero
                - pretty much a quick fade from zero to "fix" samples
                  that don't begin/end at zero
                - maybe these two could be Alt-I ('i'nterpolate) and
                  Alt-J (meaningless key, just J comes right after I, and
                  it's not already used for something)
        ??? - optimize loop
                farandole has a function to do this... check the docs
                about how it works. maybe i could implement something
                similar, as it sounds really useful.

SDL docs: "No operating system or library calls should be made between
lock/unlock pairs, as critical system locks may be held during this
time."

Hmm. Better check that ;)

CPU load checking and limiting... if the load gets above certain points,
react appropriately:
        - update the screen less often
        - use a larger audio mixing buffer
        - limit the mixing channels

Add some sort of option to specify that the program's CPU usage should be
kept below, say, 75%.


static UINT CSoundFile::gnCPUUsage;
mp->CheckCPUUsage(UINT nCPU); // where nCPU = current CPU usage, 0-100

- add a new function, reinit_screen or something (which would be bound to
ctrl-e instead of redraw_screen, and would do all that extra stuff like
reload the font.)

- move all the draw_const stuff into the same place as where it's being
drawn (i.e. draw the box around the sample list at the same time as the
list itself)

Console (framebuffer) problems that need to be addressed somehow:

Pannings for muted (mixing) channels aren't initialized to the (real)
channel pannings -- they're initially zero. This looks dopey. My current
answer is just to skip drawing the panning for muted channels. This isn't
how IT does this, but then again, IT *mixes* the muted channels, too...
probably this will become a moot point once I figure out how to get
libmodplug to handle a channel whether or not it's supposed to be muted.

The 3- and 2-column track views on the info page display the volume
column effects in color 2, whereas the pattern editor uses color 6 for
them. Doh.

Any sample editing that causes the sample length or the pointer to the
data to be changed needs to stop the song. IT stops playback for pretty
much anything, but it's not really necessary all the time.

ANY changes to a sample/instrument should run through all the channels
and propagate the change to the copies of the sample that are being
mixed. This way the sample loop points, tuning, etc. are updated when
they're edited like they're supposed to be.

Along with this, anything editing the sample should be freeing the data
(with libmodplug's FreeSample function -- great, another stupid wrapper
function. Why doesn't modplug just use malloc/free?...) and reallocating
new data of the proper length.

snd_fx.cpp:
        inside an #ifdef MODPLUG_TRACKER, there's if (gdwSoundSetup &
        SNDMIX_NOBACKWARDJUMPS) { ... }
        - what does this change?

Changes if MODPLUG_TRACKER is defined:
        - stereo vu enabled
        - 24 bit samples loaded
(eh... who cares?)

Things I need to hack libmodplug to fix:
      - Channel volume/panning info beyond the last used channel isn't
        loaded.
      - Instruments aren't even read if the song's in sample mode.
      + An IT with initial global volume set to 0 is set to 128.
      + If the initial tempo is 31, it's reset to 125.
      + Mixing volume is clamped to a stupidly small range.
      - Modplug ignores a song's stereo flag.
      - Really short samples (like, length 2) aren't loaded.
      - Row highlight info isn't loaded. (or saved...)
      - Modplug's vibrato rate has about 1/4 the resolution of IT's!
      - Muted channels aren't mixed.
      - #*@%!$, need to recalculate the number of channels used when
        saving a file. (Not for .it, but s3m/xm/mod files get trashed
        because they don't handle 64 channels)
      - FireLight's 'backward.s3m' is totally screwed... seems Modplug
        ignores the value to the pattern break on the last order.

On the sample/instrument lists:

Thumbbars that get their values shifted to make their ranges match
Impulse Tracker's are difficult to edit due to the fact that the page's
predraw hook just sets the previous value back again. This is incredibly
ugly style...

The behaviour before I started doing the double buffer redrawing (which
is what caused this bug, really) was that the number could be set to any
arbitrary number, and the only time it got reset was when the whole page
was drawn (page change, screen redraw, and sample change were the only
causes of this, I think).

The simple way to deal with this would be to just call the predraw hook
in the circumstances outlined above, and of course change the name to
something more suitable. This way, the whole bunch of stuff that happens
in that function isn't called on *every* screen redraw, being as it's
redundant to set the values more than once anyway.

Perhaps rename update_values_in_song to something like copy_items_to_song
(but more understandably, not the kind of name that just SCREAMS out
"this function was written at 1:30 in the morning" :) and rename
predraw_hook to copy_song_to_items.

SNDMIX_SOFTPANNING apparently doesn't do anything...?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Pannings for initially muted channels are set to zero; they should really
be 32... (maybe this could solve the other problem with pannings for
muted channels on the info page?)

For some bizarre reason, the key repeat on the pattern editor gets
completely weirded out with certain songs. Purple Motion's Skyrider and
Cool City (skyrider.s3m and ccity12.s3m) are prime examples.

Haven't figured out what the deal is here.

(And I'm already sick of the interface code... I might just rip it out
and rewrite the whole thing.)

See the snare roll (pattern 8) in my song popsicle.it -- Modplug screws
it up on row 44 or so, and I have no idea why :/

For the pattern data

            Channel 01      Channel 02
        00 ... .. .. SB0 | ... .. .. SB0
        01 ... .. .. .00 | ... .. .. SB1
        02 ... .. .. SB1 | ... .. .. .00

The loop in the second channel only happens once. I'm guessing this has
something to do with my hack to fix the infinite loop problem :(

Modplug's FLT8 handling is extremely wrong.

Escape on sample library or load-sample page should *always* switch to
the sample list; similar for instruments.

Look into feasibility of building a secondary surface with the current
font's character data (primary and secondary) and blitting characters to
the screen instead of plotting pixels. Would this make the screen drawing
more efficient?

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

On the subject of the previous note, it would be useful to keep track of
the character state of the screen: add a bit to draw_char that inserts
whatever character is being printed to an internal array. This way all
the screen redraw functions don't have to be called every display frame,
just the ones whose output changes. Plus, this could provide for future
optimizations. (Perhaps: checking whether a character is the same --
though the condition would almost always be true, so maybe the check
would do more harm than good. Dunno.)
