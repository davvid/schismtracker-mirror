Ok... here's the deal. This is a HACKED version of the library with a few
changes, mostly bug fixes and stuff but also some behavior changes (for
example, channel limit is changed to 256, songs repeat when they hit the
end, and various other things suited to a tracker. I do plan on sending
patches to whoever's maintaining libmodplug these days (as well as to
Olivier so they can be integrated into "official" Modplug).

All of my changes have been tagged with '<chisel>'.

Original README:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

libmodplug v0.7 - A library for decoding MOD-like music formats.
 Based on the ModPlug sound engine by Olivier Lapicque <olivierl@jps.net>
 Ported to Unix by Kenton Varda <temporal@gauge3d.org>
 Additional modifications by Markus Fick <marf@gmx.net> and
    Adam Goode <adam@evdebs.org>
 Placed in the public domain in October, 2001


All the documentation needed can be found in the comments in modplug.h.
This library should be perfectly accessible from C, although it is written
in C++.  Just #include <modplug.h> to use it, and link against
libmodplug.so.

This library has been known to compile fine in Windows using MinGW32 (A
GCC-based compiler).  Windows is not yet officially supported, however.
(With about half an hour of hacking, any decent programmer should be able
to convince WinAmp to play mods using this library. ;) )

I need a maintainer for this.  I have too many other projects I am working
on, and ModPlug has dropped low on the list.  If you would like to be the
new maintainer, please e-mail me at <temporal@gauge3d.org> and tell me why
you think you would be the right person for the job.  :)
