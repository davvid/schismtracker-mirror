|     * Sample names are displayed on the sample        _ __ ___\
|       load screen for supported file types.
|     * Mouse support in the ITF editor. (Sort of.)
|     * Changes made to the palette are saved.
|     * A couple minor bugs (which I bet nobody noticed) have been fixed.

: Umm... that's all, actually. Merry ${HOLIDAY_NAME}!

| Probably the most obvious addition for version      [version 0.15a]    /
| 0.15a is its ability to (cue fanfare) SAVE THE  _ ___ _______ ________/
| SONG! Yes, that's right, it's finally possible        _ __ ___\
| to press F10, type a filename, and save!  This
| means 0.15a is the first truly usable version.  (I've written songs using
| previous versions, but that doesn't mean they're usable. ;)
|
| Other nifty features:
|
|     * Real envelope editing! Ins/del now add and remove nodes, infinitely
|       more useful than before.
|     * Envelope nodes are drawn in a different color.  (This can be turned
|       off with the "classic mode" setting,  as are most non-IT features.)
|     * Hook scripts:  if  ~/.schism/startup-hook  and  ~/.schism/exit-hook
:       are executable,  they will be run at startup  and exit.

| I am pleased to announce the release of Schism       [version 0.1a]    /
| Tracker v0.1, with a TON of new stuff:          _ ___ _______ ________/

|     * Sample loading and saving
|     * Standalone sample playback
|     * Closer, more IT-compatible file saving
|     * Several more features implemented on the pattern editor
|     * A  handful  of added  and  improved  sample  editing keys  (notably
|       amplify, loop editing, and tuning keys)
|     * Major parts of the instrument page completed
|
| Along with  all that, Schism  now has a few  more bells and  whistles: an
| oscilloscope, global VU meters (currently  not enabled, but they do work)
| and a finally implemented 64-channel view on the info page. (I'm not sure
: why I didn't finish that a long time ago...)

| Finally, after several months of dead silence,      [version 0.04a]    /

| This version introduces a partially functional
| settings page, configuration load/save functionality, and the first steps
| toward  a sample  browser.  I  had hoped  to  introduce  much more  (like
| implementing most  of the  important keys in  the pattern  editor, proper
| file saving, and  some more eye candy  on the info page)  but the holiday
| was much busier than I was expecting and I didn't get much of a chance to
: work  on Schism.  I'm  still releasing  this as  0.04  because I've  been
. yammering about it for quite some time now.
