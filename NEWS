Schism Tracker 0.185a
---------------------

This mostly fixes some more byte-ordering problems, but introduces a
couple extra features that were requested on the message forum: Ctrl-L is
now mapped to load song, and preliminary support has been added for
default instrument filter cutoff and resonance.

Additionally, the website has been redesigned and moved to
http://rigelseven.com/schism/.
