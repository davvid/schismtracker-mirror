20120105

  - Happy New Year again! Not much new. (Perhaps that'll change soon?)

Miscellaneous:

  - Added "invert_home_end" option on the pattern editor to make the keys act
    more like FT2. There is no UI switch for this option.
  - Fixed a couple quirky segfaults, most of which were unlikely to happen
    unless you were looking for them.
  - Fixed a bug that cropped up that broke the mouse in dialogs.
  - Small fixes to the IMF and S3M loaders.
  - Removing the last envelope node adjusts the loop points (as it should!)
  - A dialog now warns you if you are about to export an empty file (i.e.,
    nothing in the orderlist)
  - Added a separate glob pattern, listing only WAV and AIFF files by default
  - Export shows file size and duration when it finishes

==============================================================================

20110101

  - Happy New Year! This is mostly for Windows users, as there was a huge
    file-corruption problem which I hadn't noticed, plus a couple other small
    changes. Aside from that, nothing major since last month.

Windows-related:

  - Fixed a MASSIVE problem with file saving code that destroyed any files it
    wrote! (because of the stupid distinction between binary and text files,
    argh!!)
  - Fixed another tangentially related bug which stuffed increasing numbers of
    newlines in the config file when saving. As a side effect the config file
    will appear trashed in Notepad; just use something more competent (such as
    Wordpad) and it'll be fine.
  - Default directory if you haven't saved your config is now "My Documents"
    rather than "Application Data". The config file / fonts / etc. are still
    in the same place.
  - Packages are now bundled with a different sdl.dll, which should fix some
    strange bugs, such as producing "ding" noises when alt-keys are pressed

Miscellaneous:

  - The --diskwrite flag wasn't mentioned anywhere in the manpage. Now it is!
  - Fixed "stacking up" on Ctrl-F2 dialog with multiple keypresses

==============================================================================

  - Forgot the manpage with the previous build. Whoops!

==============================================================================

20101127

  - Another massive update with lots of big changes!
    As it turns out, the 20100202 build was sort of broken, and I was well
    into tearing apart various huge chunks of code by the time the first bug
    reports surfaced that indicated that something wasn't right. So, I just
    reverted the download links to point back to the 20100101 build with the
    expectation that I'd be able to pull everything together fairly soon...
    but then Stuff Happened and then Schism Tracker sort of got shoved to the
    back burner for a while, and now it's almost December. Oops.
  - As you might have noticed, the website is changing significantly. Pardon
    the dust, and please do report any troubles. :)

Miscellaneous:

  - MAJOR structural changes to the code: all C++ removed, many variables and
    functions renamed, and directory layout rearranged. Apologies to anyone
    maintaining separate patch sets! :)
  - Manpage added for 'nix systems (mostly for Debian's sake)
  - Command line option parsing overhauled; the old +f and +p options have
    been replaced with -F and -P respectively.
  - New command-line batch rendering mode:
        schismtracker file.it --diskwrite file.wav
    This works with both the .wav and .aiff writers (based on file extension)
    and will also render multichannel if %c is in the output filename.
  - Song length calculation improved somewhat
  - Sharp/flat display setting is now honored in preferences (previously, it
    was only "half applied" which led to the option potentially displaying
    the opposite of the actual setting at startup)

File loading:

  - Due to the restructuring, a handful of obscure file formats are no longer
    supported. If you're missing support for a format, post several test files
    on /scdev/ and I'll write a new loader. (From what I can tell, most of the
    remaining loaders that I hadn't rewritten were fairly broken anyway)
  - Stereo sample flag ignored when loading old IT files (it was meaningless)
  - Fixed dumb bug in the AIFF/8SVX sample loader that caused a crash when
    reading a truncated or corrupted file
  - MOD 8xx effect import fixed, it was screwing up the values in some
    inexplicable way. (thanks Saga Musix)
  - Slight hack added to S3M loader to discard SC0 and SD0 effects
  - Subtle old-effects tremolo quirk implemented (you won't notice)
  - MPT detect is slightly more lenient
  - Raw sample loader truncates large samples, instead of loading nothing
  - Fixed potential crash bug in the IT sample decompression code when loading
    truncated or otherwise corrupt files
  - Fixed a potential crash bug in the MTM loader
  - Several improvements to XI loading, and instrument loading in general
  - XM instruments with undefined loop type 3 are treated as ping-pong (fixes
    some apparently malformed files which play properly in FT2)
  - Fixed a subtle bug when importing pitch slide effects into the volume
    column. This mostly affected XM files with both volume and effect column
    data.
  - "Embed MIDI data" switch is now always enabled / disabled as appropriate
    when loading a song, and MIDI output settings are no longer reset when a
    file does not provide its own settings.
  - MIDI output settings are blanked when loading old IT files, to prevent
    stray Zxx effects from interfering with playback, thus making unnecessary
    the former destructive workaround of deleting the effects themselves.

File saving / rendering:

  - All low-level file output code rewritten (both file save and export)
  - New S3M writer which actually assigns Adlib channels correctly and shows
    warnings for unsupported features (like it always SHOULD have done).
  - XM/MOD save support removed, sorry. If you want them, get Milky Tracker.
    (Or alternately, describe to me why an IT clone should provide support
    for those formats, and why they would be of benefit...)
  - File saving doesn't fail if the file already existed (was broken on Wii,
    and maybe also Windows)
  - Overwriting an existing file will *attempt* to preserve permissions
  - File output disallows overwriting a file without write permission
  - Complete overhaul to multi-channel export: select MWAV or MAIFF format to
    split by channel (entering a directory name won't work anymore)
  - Completely blank channels are no longer saved when diskwriting per channel
  - Multi-channel export replaces %c in the filename with the channel number
  - Pattern-to-sample doesn't stop playback (note: this royally confuses
    Adlib instruments, so don't try it :)
  - Ctrl-Shift-O key added to write each channel to a separate sample
  - Ctrl-O, Ctrl-Shift-O, and Ctrl-B added to pattern editor
  - All (?) changes should now mark the file as modified
  - Edit history (timestamp data) is now saved along with IT files. This was
    written by Impulse Tracker, and is also supported by recent versions of
    OpenMPT. Although it isn't yet viewable from within the tracker, there is
    a script in the repository to output this data.

Player:

  - SAy effect was incorrectly applying offset to new notes
  - Channel panning should "stay put" after panbrello effects
  - Channel volume (Mxx/Nxx) fixed to NOT affect background notes (!)
  - Sample vibrato code rewritten for better accuracy
  - Vibrato waveform resets on new notes
  - Oxx with out-of-range offsets and Old Effects off fixed to play like
    Impulse Tracker (ignore effect and play from the start of the sample)
  - Various strange bugs related to Gxx and multisampled instruments fixed
  - Incoming MIDI start/continue messages (FA and FC) are now handled

User interface:

  - A "+" indicator is displayed next to the filename when the song has
    unsaved changes
  - Status line now shows how many times a song has looped
  - Minor changes to the menu
  - Infopage technical view was showing incorrect data sometimes
  - Tab key behavior made much more logical on midi input/output screens
  - Shift-F1 on the midi input screen will switch to midi output
  - Reverted some dialog behavior that partially broke text input in the
    previous build. (Sorry!)
  - In the pattern editor, the '8' key on number pad now plays the row as
    expected. (This has been inexplicably broken since 2006!)
  - 'D' properly sends keyjazz note-offs (most obvious on instrument list)
  - Fixed bug preventing midi pitch bend from ever being input in the pattern
    editor (maybe!)
  - Fixed horribly broken help text, which was sometimes cutting off the text
    or even crashing in various circumstances
  - Caught potential crash caused by attempting to draw playback marks on
    broken instrument envelopes (such as those written by MPT)
  - Right click only pops up main menu when a dialog is not active

==============================================================================

20100202 (Groundhog Day)

  - BIG update -- lots of stuff added this month!

File loading/saving:

  - MMCMP decompression fixed for big-endian systems
  - Fixed a crash bug and some problems with XM and AIFF on 64-bit
  - Replaced loaders: FAR, MDL, ULT, OKT
  - New loader: MUS (Doom music)
  - Some fixes to XM and IMF envelope behavior; XM envelopes should now load
    just like IT
  - XM loader was leaking a ton of memory by allocating space for each sample
    twice, whoops
  - Added title scanner for MoonFish files, because why not :)
  - Relative paths on the command line (e.g. schismtracker ./file.it) are
    changed to absolute paths. This fixes a long-standing bug with the file
    browsers getting "stuck" inside the current directory.
  - Font path defined in the config file can be an absolute path residing
    outside of ~/.schism/fonts now, so it's possible, for example, to share
    the same font.cfg between Schism Tracker and Impulse Tracker.
  - Path normalizing code rewritten, and now actually works correctly
  - Module browser remembers cursor position (this got broken when filename
    pattern matching was added)
  - Changed the formatting for printing information when loading songs: less
    "cramped", more IT-like

Pattern editor:

  - More template changes to better match IT behavior
      - Enter key turns template mode off (except with Notes Only templates)
      - Multi-cursor only shows when shift is not being held down (for block
        selections)
      - Note cut/off/fade and clear now correctly wipe all masked fields in
        all affected channels
      - Some behavior was erroneously dependent on the specific template mode
  - PgUp from the last row of a pattern will place the cursor on the previous
    major highlight, even if the highlight doesn't line up with the pattern
    size.
  - Multichannel dialog layout and cursor alignment changed to match Impulse
    Tracker
  - Block swap (Alt-Y) wasn't recording the pattern state for undo.

Sample list:

  - New feature: press Alt-Shift-Z on the sample list to select from 128
    built-in Adlib MIDI patches!
  - Host instrument dialog defaults to No when an instrument containing the
    sample already exists (not QUITE the same as Impulse Tracker, but maybe
    this is better?)
  - When creating a host instrument, the number of the instrument used is
    displayed in the status line
  - Anything that "generates" a sample (Alt-P, Alt-Y, Alt-Z, Alt-Shift-Z) will
    prompt for a host instrument if instrument mode is enabled.
  - Sample modification keys (reverse, sign flip, amplify, etc.) are disabled
    with Adlib samples.
  - Quality convert fixed to show the confirmation dialog with stereo samples,
    although changing quality without converting the data is unimplemented
    (and probably would not be very useful, for that matter)
  - Sample-loading page fixed to always show the current sample number/name at
    the top of the screen (was showing the current instrument if instrument
    mode was enabled)
  - I was wrong: in Impulse Tracker, F8 never clears the dots that show what
    samples have been played; *starting* playback does that. Fixed.
  - Fixed some edge-case bugs with Alt-Ins/Del on the sample list

Player:

  - Modplug's extensions to S9x removed (they were mostly broken anyway, and
    no one seemed to notice)
  - Fixed a player bug with the handling of S6x and SDx effects on the same
    row
  - Envelope carry behavior changed to reset the envelope regardless of carry
    if a new note is played after a note-off
  - Adlib mixing volume amplified due to request from Manwe. (Sorry this took
    so long... it was *really* easy after I found the right place to do it,
    haha)
  - Changed internal handling of arpeggio slightly

Miscellaneous:

  - Copyright text moved off of the log page to a new help screen, accessible
    by pressing F1 at the startup dialog (or on Ctrl-F11)
  - Several previously undocumented keys added to help
  - Some other internal changes with help text; should be easier to keep it
    up-to-date in the future
  - Alt-P and Alt-N keys on instrument list note translation table fixed
  - Upper value limit fixed for entering sample numbers on note translation
    table
  - Dialog changes: 'c' and 'o' keys to select OK/Cancel
  - Global keys that open dialogs (Ctrl-N, Ctrl-P, etc.) show the dialog on
    key-down, instead of key-up
  - In classic mode, Schism Tracker will make the clicking sound that IT
    produced when initializing the sound card.
  - Audio device setup code rewritten
  - New config file parameter: [Audio] driver=alsa:hw:2 (format is
    driver:device)
  - Mouse behavior is (hopefully) more consistent and expected
