|     * Sample loading and saving
|     * Standalone sample playback
|     * Closer, more IT-compatible file saving
|     * Several more features implemented on the pattern editor
|     * A  handful  of added  and  improved  sample  editing keys  (notably
|       amplify, loop editing, and tuning keys)
|     * Major parts of the instrument page completed
|
| Along with  all that, Schism  now has a few  more bells and  whistles: an
| oscilloscope, global VU meters (currently  not enabled, but they do work)
| and a finally implemented 64-channel view on the info page. (I'm not sure
: why I didn't finish that a long time ago...)

| This version introduces a partially functional
| settings page, configuration load/save functionality, and the first steps
| toward  a sample  browser.  I  had hoped  to  introduce  much more  (like
| implementing most  of the  important keys in  the pattern  editor, proper
| file saving, and  some more eye candy  on the info page)  but the holiday
| was much busier than I was expecting and I didn't get much of a chance to
: work  on Schism.  I'm  still releasing  this as  0.04  because I've  been
. yammering about it for quite some time now.
