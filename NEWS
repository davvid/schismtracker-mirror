| This version introduces a partially functional
| settings page, configuration load/save functionality, and the first steps
| toward  a sample  browser.  I  had hoped  to  introduce  much more  (like
| implementing most  of the  important keys in  the pattern  editor, proper
| file saving, and  some more eye candy  on the info page)  but the holiday
| was much busier than I was expecting and I didn't get much of a chance to
: work  on Schism.  I'm  still releasing  this as  0.04  because I've  been
. yammering about it for quite some time now.
