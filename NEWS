Schism Tracker 0.19a
--------------------

Sample drawing is much, much faster. This comes at the expense of some
accuracy for very large samples, but I don't think anyone will notice.

0.19a adds command line options: try schism --help for a list of what
neat tricks it can do. A particularly useful combination is -a disk -p
filename.it, to use the disk audio driver (which saves to sdlaudio.raw)
and immediately start playing. A word of caution, though; the song will
still loop, and the disk writer doesn't know when Schism Tracker is
stopped, so if you aren't paying close enough attention, you could easily
end up with a 300 MB file.

There are a couple of new key bindings. In the pattern editor,
Alt-Shift-Q/A transpose notes by a full octave. Alt-T on the sample list
(save S3I sample in Impulse Tracker) brings up a sample export dialog.
Finally, the delete key in the module browser removes files.

The menus have been slightly reorganized, removing the Shell to DOS
item from the File menu and adding a new Settings menu.

The sample and instrument lists have playback dots.

Editing an instrument envelope enables it, and changing a loop point
turns on the loop. Ignore, for a moment, the fact that envelope loop
editing is fairly broken. :P

In the config file, there is a setting to make backups when saving a
module. It can be enabled by editing ~/.schism/config, going to the
[General] section, and adding the line make_backups=1. There isn't a
corresponding option in the GUI for this yet.

Of course, there's a few bug fixes here as well, but none of them are
really worth talking about, so pay no attention to this sentence.
